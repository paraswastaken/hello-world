        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound fresh morel mushrooms - dirt gently brushed off and mushrooms halved lengthwise</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 cup vegetable shortening</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Place halved morel mushrooms in a large bowl; cover with cold, lightly salted water. Refrigerate mushrooms for about 5 minutes to loosen any dirt; pour off salted water, rinse, and repeat twice more. Crevices of the mushrooms may harbor tiny stones or even insects. Thoroughly rinse mushrooms a final time and allow to drain on paper towels.</li>
                <li>Place flour in a shallow bowl.</li>
                <li>Heat vegetable shortening in a large skillet until very hot.</li>
                <li>Roll mushrooms in flour and tap off excess; gently lay mushrooms in the hot shortening.</li>
                <li>Pan-fry until golden brown and flour coating is crisp, 5 to 8 minutes, turning often. Drain morels on paper towels, salt to taste, and enjoy your treasures!</li>
            </ol>
